# Mars Data Challenge

You’re now ready to take on the full web-scraping and data analysis project for the mission to Mars. You’ve learned to identify HTML elements on a page, identify their id and class attributes, and use this knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. You’ve also learned to scrape various types of information. These include HTML tables and recurring elements, like multiple news articles on a webpage.

Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles. Optionally export the data into a JSON file or a MongoDB database.

Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyse Mars weather data, which exists in a table.

Answer the following question: How many months exist on Mars?

Answer the following question: How many Martian (and not Earth) days' worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?

Answer the following question: What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)? Get the answer by averaging the minimum daily temperature of all the months. Plot the results as a bar chart.

Answer the following question: Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars? Get the answer by averaging the daily atmospheric pressure of all the months. Plot the results as a bar chart.

Answer the following question: About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year? That is, in the time that Mars circles the Sun once, how many days elapse on Earth? Visually estimate the result by plotting the daily minimum temperature.
